# MyReads Project


### Description
This is the seventh project in the Front End Web Development nanodegree at Udacity. I was provided some starter code consisting of a static markup of a bookshelf app. My task has been to add interactivity and completing the app with functional React code so the user can select and categorize books they have read, want to read or are currently reading.

### How to run the app
* Download the project files to your local machine.
* Install all project dependencies with ```npm install```in your terminal or command line.
* Start the server with ```npm start``` which should open the app in your browser, if not you can access it by opening *http://localhost:3000* in your browser.

### Important - Search terms
The project uses a backend server provided by Udacity. The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in SEARCH_TERMS.md. That list of terms are the only terms that will work with the backend.
